Welcome to the Rust Blockchain Indexer project! This indexer is designed to efficiently parse and index blockchain data, providing developers with a powerful tool to interact with blockchain data using the Rust programming language.

## Features

- **Efficient Parsing**: Utilizes Rust's performance and safety to efficiently parse blockchain data.
- **Customizable Indexing**: Offers flexibility in indexing parameters to suit various blockchain architectures.
- **Concurrency**: Leverages Rust's concurrency features for parallel processing, enhancing indexing speed.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Implements robust error handling mechanisms to ensure stability and reliability.
- **Extensible**: Designed with modularity in mind, making it easy to extend and integrate with other projects.
- **Well-Documented**: Provides comprehensive documentation for easy understanding and integration.

## Installation

To use the Rust Blockchain Indexer, you need to have Rust installed. You can install Rust by following the instructions on the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Once Rust is installed, you can add the Rust Blockchain Indexer to your project by adding it as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
blockchain-indexer = "0.1.0"
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how you can use the Rust Blockchain Indexer in your project:

```rust
use blockchain_indexer::{BlockchainIndexer, IndexingConfig};

fn main() {
    // Initialize the blockchain indexer with your desired configuration
    let config = IndexingConfig::default();
    let indexer = BlockchainIndexer::new(config);

    // Start indexing blockchain data
    indexer.start_indexing();
}
```
